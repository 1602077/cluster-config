# clusters

Contains cluster specific config controlling which `/components` are deployed
and what overlays to apply for each cluster.

If using a service like `crossplane` this can contain the definitions for all
clusters.

<!-- TODO (jack, 13/08/2023): Create minkube.local & gke.dev clusters. -->
